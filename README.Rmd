## Overview

`tmuxr` is an R package that allows you to manage [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) and interact with the processes it runs. It features a pipeable API with which you can create, control, and capture tmux sessions, windows, and panes.

## Installation

The development version of `tmuxr` can be installed with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("datascienceworkshops/tmuxr")
```

## A demonstration

```{r, include = FALSE}
options(tmux_socket_name = "readme")
tmuxr::kill_server()
```

To get an idea of what `tmuxr` has to offer, consider the following example, where we run two different versions of R in order to compare the output of the function `t.test()`. It's perhaps a bit contrived, but it allows us to demonstrate the various capabilities of `tmuxr`.  Let's start by creating a tmux session that runs a recent version of R locally.

```{r}
library(tmuxr)
s <- new_session(name = "demo", shell_command = "R --vanilla", height = 13)
```

We don't see anything---because a session starts in detached mode by default---but there's now a pane with a size of 80 by 13 with which we can interact.

```{r, include = FALSE}
Sys.sleep(0.5)
```

```{r}
(p <- select_pane_active(s))
```

With the `send_keys()` function, we can simulate typing into that pane. To verify that this works, we can use the `capture_pane()` function to take a "screenshot". 
 
```{r}
send_keys(p, "pi", "Enter")
cat(capture_pane(p, cat = TRUE))
```

That seems to work, so let's continue by creating a new pane that runs a different version of [R using Docker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker). Notice that both panes now have a height of 6 lines because the window was split vertically.

```{r}
p2 <- split_window(s, shell_command = "docker run --rm -it rocker/r-ver:3.1.0")
name(p2) <- "r-3.1"
list_panes()
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
Sys.sleep(1)
```

With `purrr::map`, we can interact with multiple processes in parallel. Here, we run the `t.test()` function with some dummy data and inspect the result.

```{r}
purrr::map(list_panes(), send_keys,
           "(result <- t.test(1:10, y = c(7:20)))", "Enter",
           "result$stderr", "Enter")
Sys.sleep(0.5)

cat(capture_pane(p, cat = TRUE))

cat(capture_pane(p2, cat = TRUE))
```

Indeed, in R version 3.1, `t.test()` does not return the standard error of the mean. To stop both the local R process and the Docker container we can simply kill the session.   

```{r}
kill_session(s)
```

That concludes the demonstration. Note that tmux (and, as a result `tmuxr`) can run any process that runs in a terminal, not just R. Please have a look at [the reference](reference/) to learn more about what `tmuxr` has to offer.


## Compatibility

We [regularly test](https://travis-ci.org/datascienceworkshops/tmuxr) `tmuxr` on Ubuntu with tmux versions 2.1 through 3.1 and on macOS with the latest version of tmux provided by Homebrew. `tmuxr` might work on Windows using Cygwin or WSL, but we haven't tested this.
