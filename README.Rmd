## Overview

`tmuxr` is an R package that allows you (1) to manage [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) and (2) to interact with the processes it runs. It features a pipeable API with which you can create, control, and capture tmux sessions, windows, and panes.

Most functions, such as `new_session`, `list_windows`, and `send_keys` are wrappers by the commands `tmux` offers. Other functions, such as `attach_window` and `send_lines` are added for convenience.

## Installation

The development version of `tmuxr` from GitHub can be installed with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("datascienceworkshops/tmuxr")
```

## License

The `tmuxr` package is licensed under the MIT License.
